UofT Coders Exec Meeting
2018-07-23

Present: Joel, Madeleine, Lina, Sara, Elliott

- Thank-you gift cards for instructors
    - get physical cards for people to sign at each event, then email a gift card to the instructor (i.e. Starbucks)
    - ideally UofT Coders can purchase the gift cards directly, but maybe not because of our funding structure. If not, then the purchaser will just have to submit receipts.
    - problem with giving physical cards is where to store them safely so they can be handed out at events - for this reason, e-cards are ideal.
- Data Carpentry in September
    - Where: Robarts first, then check MADLab
    - When: Early September. Joel will let Madeleine,
